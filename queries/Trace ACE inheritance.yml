description: When BloodHound shows that an inherited ACE applies to an object it does not show the source/where it is inherited from from (OU, Container, Domain root) - the source is where it should be remediated. This query can sometimes find the source of an inherited ACE, but only works if the ACE is set to also apply to the source itself.
query: |-
  // Replace INSERT_OBJECT_ID with the affected principal
  // Replace 'GenericAll' with the specific edge you're tracing
  WITH "INSERT_OBJECT_ID" as OID
  MATCH p=()-[:GenericAll {isacl:true,isinherited:false}]->()-[:Contains*1..]->(:Base{objectid:OID})
  WHERE NONE(ou in NODES(p) WHERE ou:OU AND ou.isaclprotected IS NOT NULL)
  RETURN p
